By the means of that he is too scared of not being able to finish what he started because of his weak resolve  and thus tries to hide it from others with his surroundings. Tojiro is also a bit too talkative and happens to expose most of his friends secret by pure accident  and cause fo that can cause high friction in his friend ships. When tojiro faces failure  he tends to lose his will and gives up pretty easily wich is a very detrimental thing about him."

Aiko mostly tries to be a 'perfect girl' but when she gets close to you get to see her fun and adventurous side.

Aiko does intend to be seen this way and feels more safe and does appreciate the attention, she doesn't brag but she might 'show off' sometimes in an undirect way. She sometimes finds it a bit surprising when she is seen as controlled or mature because even if she is, she has a side of her that rarely comes out, panic with a mix of loss of mind.
